# /init file for the "Slingshot vs Kali" Thread

**Date:** November 19, 2025  
**Topic:** Comparison between Slingshot Linux and Kali Linux for Prox Offensive workflows.  
**Context:** User posted on LinkedIn about their host-based workflow and received a suggestion from Bryson Bort to check out the Slingshot distro.

---

## Key Points Covered:
- **Bryson Bort's Suggestion:** Bryson recommended Slingshot because it aligns with a structured, professional red/purple team workflow rather than just a tool-based approach.
- **Comparison Summary:** Slingshot is built for operational structure (reporting templates, engagement directories, emulation support) while Kali is a general-purpose toolbox.
- **Relevance to User:** Fits the Prox Offensive and DonTrabajoGPT vision by offering a more disciplined, AI-integrated, and team-friendly platform for real-world ops.

## Next Steps:
- Integrate Slingshot into the Prox Offensive workflow if desired.
- Consider a hybrid setup where Slingshot handles engagement structure and Kali remains the “execution blade.”
- Update ReconOps Prox agent to fit Slingshot’s folder structure if transitioning.
