This directory contains operational guides, model behavior analysis, workflow blueprints, and reference materials that support the `/init` multi-agent system.

## Structure

### 1. **index.md**
High-level overview of the documentation set. Start here.

### 2. **model_roles.md**
Objective comparison of GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Local LLMs.  
Explains why model selection must be contextual rather than dogmatic.

A complete walkthrough of the Prox Offensive multi-agent workflow, including model chaining, reviewer lanes, and private synthesis.

### 4. **local_llm_setup.md** (future)
Guides for setting up offline models (gpt-oss-20B, DeepSeek, llama.cpp, Ollama) on macOS and Linux.

### 5. **cli_tools.md** (future)
Install and use the GPT CLI, Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, and how to wire them into the mesh.

### 6. **atlas_lane.md** (future)
How to integrate the Atlas Browser as a safe research lane without leaking information.

### 7. **duck_reviewer_loop.md** (future)
Ensemble reasoning and cross-model verification workflow using Duck.ai.

## Purpose

The goal of this documentation is to keep:
- research reproducible  
- workflows consistent  
- reasoning transparent  
- sensitive logic private  
- large projects manageable  

This structure prevents information sprawl and keeps the lab aligned as it evolves.
