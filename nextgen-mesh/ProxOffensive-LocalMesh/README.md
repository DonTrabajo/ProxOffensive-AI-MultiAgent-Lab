# Prox Offensive · Local-First Cyber Mesh (Next-Gen)

This repository defines and implements the **next-generation, local-first, CLI-first, AI-routed mesh**
for Prox Offensive operations.

It is the evolution of the original Multi-Agent Lab architecture, with key upgrades:

- Local LLMs as the **primary reasoning engine**
- Cloud models (GPT, Claude, Gemini 3) as **specialists**, not the core brain
- Slingshot as the **operational engagement OS**
- Kali as a lean, disposable **offensive blade**
- Host as the **AI orchestration core**
- MacBook as the **creative + heavy local LLM lane**
- CLI-first workflows inspired by terminal-native AI usage

## Repo Goals

- Provide a **clean, reproducible reference** for a modern red-team AI mesh
- Offer **ready-to-use docs**, CLI wrappers, and integration patterns
- Separate **next-gen experiments** from the original architecture repo
