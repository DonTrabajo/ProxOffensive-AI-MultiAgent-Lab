Been tightening up my offensive security workflow, and this week I focused on the foundation: my host machine CLI and AI stack.

I now have a clean Windows-based workspace where all my repos, notes, loot, and long-term research live. Kali is kept strictly as the execution blade. The host handles the thinking, documenting, AI reasoning, and version control.

Highlights:
• Custom PowerShell profile for navigation and repo awareness  
• A “DonT’sWorkspace” shortcut that drops me straight into the dev orbit  
• Local AI (Ollama) running private models for planning and analysis  
• User-scoped Python with OpenAI & Gemini SDKs ready for future cloud use  
• Shared-folder pipeline so Kali exports loot directly into my host workspace  
• Unified repo structure for Prox Offensive and DonTrabajoGPT  

Next step: integrating ReconOps Prox deeper into this environment.
