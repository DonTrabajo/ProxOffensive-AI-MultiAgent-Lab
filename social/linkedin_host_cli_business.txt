Prox Offensive continues evolving its internal tooling and workflow. This week we finalized the Host AI Orchestration environment supporting our red-team development and research labs.

We now maintain a structured Windows-based workspace for:
• Repository development (ReconOps Prox, DonTrabajoGPT)  
• Local AI analysis using private LLMs (Ollama)  
• Documentation pipelines and writeup workflows  
• Storage and processing of reconnaissance and lab artifacts  

Kali remains the execution layer for enumeration and exploitation.  
The host has become the orchestration and analysis hub — making the overall workflow cleaner, faster, and fully repeatable.
